Hey, you! What are you doing here? Welcome, this is just my internet crib.

<p>Anyway, some things about me:</p>

<ul>
    <li>I write software ðŸ‘¾</li>
    <li>I'm interested in: systems programming, cli/tui/gui apps, writing stories and... you?!</li>
    <li><del><i>REDACTED</i></del></li>
</ul>

<p>I know the title of the site ambitiously says "Programming, *Manga* & *Games*" -- I'm so lost that I'm procrastinating reading manga. It'll be okay. It.... or... will it be okay?</p>

<p>I've been maintaing this site since July, 2023. It is a bit crazy to think that 2 years have passed -- though, other than the occasional re-design sparked by mental breakdowns not much has changed. It's built using Zola, which was sort of an arbitrary choice based on nothing but the axiom that Hugo is too much.</p>
